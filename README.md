=====

Backend processing systems for the t8pe player. V0.1.

CONTENT TYPES:
Adds "Song" and "Playlist" (of which "album" can be considered a subclass, but is not yet implemented).

TAXONOMIES:
Adds "Artist" and "Album" taxonomies, for organizing the metadata thereof.

USER ROLES:
Adds "Artist" and "Curator" roles, without capabilities as of yet. Eventually they will be able to edit their own Songs & Playlists or just Playlists, depending.

Still to do:
- Bitcoin plugin
- paypal plugin
- Google payments plugin
- documentation of any kind :D
